# Chef-Kiss-Code
Our code samples contains two most important parts of the prototype: receipt scanner and food recipe recommendation based on leftover food. Each of the code script (*.py) can be executed with `python <filename>.py`.
## Recipe Recommender
Utilized dataset from Kaggle for list of recipes and ingredients.
*Note: The recommender only lists the ID of the recipes since the dataset does not have recipe name itself.
